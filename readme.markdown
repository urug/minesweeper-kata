# Minesweeper Kata

In this repository you'll find everything you need (and more besides) to perform your own [minesweeper Kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataMinesweeper) in Ruby.

There are five iterations of Cucumber acceptance tests for the kata, building up from a simple blank board of a fixed size, to different sizes of boards with multiple mines.


## Iterations

The requirements for each iteration can be accessed by merging in the tag for the iteration.

So to begin, run

    git checkout iteration-1
    
Then, when you have the first scenario passing, run

    git merge iteration-2
    
Try not to change the code in the features folder, it should not be necessary.


## Solution

If you want to see some solutions, look at master's HEAD for the solution that the Songkick team came up with one evening, or see the solution branch for mattwynne's first effort.


## Play Along!

Fork the repo and try out the kata yourself. Run the rake task (only in HEAD, sorry, my git-fu is weak!) and see how low you can get your flog scores.
